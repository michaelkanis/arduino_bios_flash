arduino_bios_flash
==================

This is the code I used for flashing my BIOS chip using Arduino.

When I bricked my BIOS chip by flashing a wrong BIOS version onto it, I used this combination of a small Java program
and a C program running on Arduino Uno to unbrick it.

It's rather crude, but in case somebody can make use of it here it is.

Use at your own risk and please only use this if you know what you're doing.
